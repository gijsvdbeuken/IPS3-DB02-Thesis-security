## Chapter 1: Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

### Problem Definition

In a web application, it is often crucial to secure certain parts of the application and make them accessible only to authorized users. This security can be further strengthened by associating specific user codes with certain pages, adding an extra layer of protection.

The current system faces the challenge that some pages in the application should only be accessible to users with specific codes linked to their accounts. These codes are managed behind the scenes and are intended to grant access to sensitive or restricted information.

### Main question

How can a web application effectively implement secure routes, allowing users access only to specific pages, and what mechanisms are necessary to ensure a flexible user experience?

### Sub-question 1

Which authentication mechanisms can be applied to verify the identity of users?

### Sub-question 2

How can the web application manage user profiles and enable personalization within the secure environment?

### Goal

**The primary goal of this thesis is to investigate, analyze, and propose effective strategies for securing web applications by implementing secure routes, restricting access to specific pages through user codes, and enhancing user authentication mechanisms. The study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the challenges posed by the current system, explore viable security mechanisms, examine user authentication strategies, delve into user profile management and personalization within secure environments, and present practical case studies.** 

**Ultimately, the thesis seeks to contribute valuable insights and recommendations for improving the security and flexibility of web applications, ensuring a robust and user-friendly experience for authorized users while safeguarding sensitive information.**
